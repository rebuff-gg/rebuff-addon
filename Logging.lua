-- Rebuffed · Logging.lua — client-flavor detection + the combat-log recording GUARANTEE.
--
-- This is the addon's highest-value job and the first vertical of "recording": whenever you are
-- playing, the engine-written WoWCombatLog.txt IS being written, with advanced params, cleanly,
-- for the WHOLE time — not just in instances. There is no opt-out, and if logging is ever off we
-- complain heavily and repeatedly until it is back on.
--
-- Cross-client (Midnight "WoW Forever" + Classic/SoD):
--   Midnight's Secret Values (12.0) make in-combat CLEU unreadable to addons, so the file is the
--   only clean path. Classic/SoD have NO Secret Values (CLEU is readable) — but we deliberately use
--   the SAME file-guarantee + landmark model on both so there is a single code path. The only
--   sanctioned APIs we touch here exist on every flavor: SetCVar/GetCVar("advancedCombatLogging"),
--   LoggingCombat(bool) and LoggingCombat() (query).
